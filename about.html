    <p> The goal of the Doctor appointment SYSTEM System is to improve the efficiency of the health by reducing the overall time and cost used to create documents and retrieve information. .

        The main feature of E-Knowledge in Doctor appointment system is to provide the browser to get appointments from a doctor through internet instead of going there and fixing an appointment..
